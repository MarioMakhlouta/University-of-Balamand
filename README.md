Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection includes various academic projects completed during my studies in computer and electrical engineering. Below are brief descriptions of each project, organized by course and topic. 

## Projects

### 1. **Delivery System (CSIS215)**
   - **Description**: A delivery management system built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows companies to manage orders, deliveries, and schedules efficiently.
   - **Technologies Used**: Java, OOP
   - **Key Features**:
     - Create, manage, and delete orders
     - Schedule deliveries
     - Track delivery status
   - **Folder**: `Delivery System Project`
   
### 2. **Scientific Calculator (ELEN202)**
   - **Description**: A scientific calculator developed using MATLAB to perform complex mathematical calculations such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
   - **Technologies Used**: MATLAB
   - **Key Features**:
     - Trigonometric and logarithmic operations
   - **Folder**: `Scientific Calculator`
   
### 3. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (CPEN202)**
   - **Description**: This project involves the design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Quartus Prime. The ALU can perform operations like addition, subtraction, and set less than (STL).
   - **Technologies Used**: Quartus Prime
   - **Key Features**:
     - Perform arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logic (AND, OR, STL) operations
     - Simple design for educational purposes
   - **Folder**: `Arithmetic Logic Unit`

### 4. **Temperature Transducer using OP-AMP (ELEN303)**
   - **Description**: A temperature transducer circuit using operational amplifiers (OP-AMP) to convert voltage output. The project was simulated in Multisim for accurate analysis and design.
   - **Technologies Used**: Multisim, OP-AMP
   - **Key Features**:
     - Temperature sensing and conversion
     - Circuit analysis and simulation using Multisim
   - **Folder**: `Temperature transducer`
